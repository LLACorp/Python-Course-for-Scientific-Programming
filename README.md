# PYTHON COURSE FOR SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING  

This course is aimed for a 5 day intensive introduction to Python. Each lesson will be 2 hours long. During the first hour (and twenty) of each module the lecturer will expose the concepts wrtting code live in the projected computer screen. The lesson will be exposed in a Jupyter Notebook such that each code line can be immediately executed and its effects visuali√ßed in any future moment. The idea is that each of the students will have access to a computer with the IDE Spyder or Jupyter Notebook, such that they will follow the lecturer by typing concurrently the same exposed code. The lesson will merge the  explanation of basic concepts with usage examples that will make the lectures very practice-oriented. The last hour/half-hour a list of problems will be proposed for the attendants to solve on their own. The lecturer and his helpers will wander around the class to assist the students that need help with particular problems, concerns or misconceptions.

After each day, the Notebook generated by the lecturer will be uploaded to this same public Github repository and be open for any student.
