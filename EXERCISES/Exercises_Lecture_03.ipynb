    "\n",
    "Saying that we want to represent a number in base $n$, say base $2$, means that we wish to represent numbers using only $n$ symbols. For example, if $n=2$, we wish to represent any number but only using two different symbols, like $\\{0,1\\}$, if $n=10$, we wish to represent any number using the symbols in $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$. If say $n=16$, we wish to represent any number using 16 different symbols like $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number system we humans use is in base 10, which is convenient for arbitrary reasons like the fact we generally have 10 fingers. However, for a computer to save numbers it is more convenient to use only two symbols rather than 10. Why? Because saving two symbols physically can be done by having current (1) or not having it (0) in a transistor, or having (1) or not having (0) voltage, which is a very easy thing yo verify even with a tolerance for error. If we instead wanted to encode 10 different symbols with the state of a transistor, we would require the reader of the transistor to be able to distinguish with precision 10 different current flow ranges in the transistor. Which, as you may know, in a transistor of 10 nm is not an easy task. Therefore, the computer internally works with numbers in binary, aka, $n=2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us denote by $(\\cdot)_n$ the number $\\cdot$ in $n$ base representation. If we do not specify the base with these parenthesis, we will assume it is in decimal base. This means that for example:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(509.389)_{10}=5\\cdot 10^2+0\\cdot 10^1 + 9\\cdot 10^0+3\\cdot 10^-1+8\\cdot 10^{-2}+9\\cdot 10^{-3}=589.389\n",

    "As you can notice with this last example, if we use a base with more symbols than 10, it is important to know the order in which they are settled to make the correspondance to base 10. That is, we need to know $(a)_{16}=10$ or $(f)_{16}=15$. So when we design a number system, we must fix the order of the symbols we will use, such as fixing that $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f\\}$ is the **ordered** set of symbols in base 16, where the index of the element gives us the integer \"in decimal base\".\n",

    "**RED PILL EXPLANATION** (from zero): To do this, first, let us remember how to compute the length of a curve. Imagine a curved line in the 2D real plane. We could continously track the points of the curve using an $\\mathbb{R}^2$ vector $(x,y)$ for each point in the curve. That is, we could use the vectors $(x(t),y(t))$, indexed by a real parameter $t$. You can think it as the position in 2D for a particle (say, an electron) at each time $t$. Let us denote this curve or trajectory for the particle, or 2D position vector moving in time, as $\\vec{r}(t)=(x(t),y(t))$. Now, we all know that the time derivative of the position vector, the **velocity vector** for the trajectory of a particle, $\\frac{d\\vec{r}(t)}{dt}$, denoted typically as $\\vec{v}(t)$, is always parallel and tangent to the trajectory of the particle (it points in the direction where the particle will move next). This is because by the definition of the integral, for very close times $t_0,t_0+\\Delta t$:\n",

If for a $\\Delta t$ small time increment, the particle has been displaced in space a vector $\\vec{v}(t_0)\\cdot \\Delta t$, as we were saying, since this displacement vector has units of space, we can know how many, say meters, has the particle moved knowing the magnitude of this displacement vector (you can look at the image and acknowledge that the displacement vector's length is the space distance traced by the particle):\n",

We can avoid this problem by noting the following. Take an equilateral triangle with the three sides equal 1. If you fit three equilateral triangles of side 1, into a trapezoid as in the image (as a partial \"triforce\"), you will see that their shared edges that have length one, can be thought of as the radious of a half circumference. Since the three triangles are the same, this proves **their shared edges divide the half circumference in three equal arcs** (each will have length $\\pi/3$. Finally, since the height of the equilateral triangle cuts the opposite edge in two segments of same length $1/2$, we see that the $x$ coordinate at which the half circumference is cut in three is $x=1/2$. This proves that the **length of the circumference from $x=-1/2$ to $x=1/2$ is exactly** one third of the circumference, that is, **$\\pi/3$**.\n",
