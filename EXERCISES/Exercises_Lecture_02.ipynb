In this package there are some special numbers that must be defined using `Decimal('·')`. For example, we can represent the number $1.32$ with `Decimal('1.32')` (note the string `'` surrounding the number to be represented!). One of the interesting things these numbers have, is that we can fix the precision with which we wish to work, using `getcontext().prec = 300` if for instance we wish to work with 300 decimal places.\n",

    "The `decimal` package has some more very interesting features. One such feature is the fact that the arithmetic is done precisely in base 10, meaning that `0.1+0.1+0.1-0.3` will be `0`, unlike in floats (try it! it is $4.44\\cdot 10^{-17}$ in floats!). This was not exact for `float`s because their opertaions are defined in binary, and `0.1` in binary is an infinite decimal place periodic number: it is `0.000110011001100110011...`.\n",
    "Thus, as the machine only saves some decimal places, the operation will never be exact! Just as if you try to compute $\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{3} - 1$ using finite decimal numbers. If say, you only used three decimals, you would do $0.333+0.333+0.333=0.999$, which is not 1! Only if you really used the infinite decimals would be 1.\n",

    "Don't panic for this revelation that machines do not even compute $0.1+0.1+0.1-1$ correctly! Because, yes, even the satellites that we send to orbit or autonomous cars in which we delegate people's security, or even particle physics simulations, all of them have finite precision arithmetic (they do not even use packages like `decimal`). Maybe only financial countables want to have precise arithmetic and save until the last one of the possible decimals. In realistic scientific scenarios this will not be a problem, because we typically work in \"normalized\" units. For each physical variable we manipulate, we typically represent them in the computer in units that are in a convenient range. For example, we never say \"the radious of this hydrogen atom is $0.00000000005$ meters\", we say it has $0.5$ Angstroms, $50$ picometers or $0.05$ **nanometers**!"
