    "As a side note, remember that everything in the end (in the memeory of the computer) is saved and manipulated in bits (0-s and 1-s), this means that in reality in the memory of the computer there is nowhere a letter `a`. Instead if for example we want to encode the 27 characters of the alphabet, we could give each letter a unique tag using sequences of 5 bits (there are 32 possible sequences since $2^5=32$). If so, we could say `a` will be the sequence $00000$, `b` will be $00001$, `c` will be $00010$ etc. Such that in memory we will save the text `acb` as $000000001000001$. Then when we want to read it again, we will need to specify in which encoding the text is codified to be able to convert it back to characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first encoding standards for text was the so called ASCII standard based on the alphabet and symbols for English, which used 7 bits to encode about 127 different symbols or characters, among them the alphabetic characters, the numerical digits, symbols like `?` or `!` and some other special characters like `\\n` representing line breaks, or some representing the end of a text file among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today there are several standardized encodings, and each operative system (OS) has its preferred ones. ASCII was the main encoding used in Internet until December 2007, when it was surpassed by UTF-8 using 8 bits (and thus allowing double symbols to be coded).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function `open()`, we can also add a thrid argument indicating the **encoding** for the characters we will deal with in this file. If we do not specify it, Python will just use the default encoding on the OS. But in general, we could specify any of the encodings listed in the following table of the official Python documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings)\n",
    "\n",
    "for example we could write `'utf_8'` or `'ascii'` as a third argument, say:\n",
    "\n",
    "`open(\"File.txt\", \"w\", \"utf_8) `\n"

    "The file handle we have created (the variable we decided to call `fileHandle`) is in reality an object with a pointer to a specific position of the text file. You can imagine it as the **cursor** that appears when you are writting something on a computer, just that this time you cannont see where the cursor is (it is this what we called \"Pointer position\" in the first table of the lecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this file handle is like a variable, but which not only contains information, it also has associated functions that allow the user to do multiple things to the file pointed by the handle (it is a class instance, as we will comment in the end of the lecture). One of these functions is `.write()`. The string we pass to it as an argument will be written to the file in the last position we have added something (in the position of the cursor). That is, we can call to it multiple times and the added text will be sequential in the file.\n",

The path is the location of a file or directory in the tree of directories of the persistent memory of the computer. We can provide it in two ways. A **relative path** is a path given from the point the Python interpreter is being executed and on (in our case, from the directory of the Jupyter Notebook and down there). For instance, imagine you have the following tree of directories under the folder where this Jupyter Notebook called Lecture_05.ipynb is:"

    "Then, if we want to save the text in the folder \"Save_the_text_here_Folder\" under the folder \"Folder_1\" which is insider the \"Python_Course\" folder where this notebook is, you will do:\n",

    "\n",
    "This path `\"Folder_1/Save_the_texts_here_Folder/File.txt\"` is the a so called relative path.\n",

    "If instead you want to save things anywhere in the directory structure, we will need to write the full path from the beginning of the tree of folders, for example something like `\"/home/xabier/Documents/UAB/My_texts/File.txt\"`. This is called an **absolute path**, since there is no doubt where I am trying to save it. That is, even if I move the Jupyter Notebook to other places in memory, the text file will always be created in the same place! \n",

    "##### Important note for Windows vs Linux/MacOS users\n",
    "In Linux and MacOS, the directory structure always starts in a `\"/\"` and the next subfolders are indicated with a bar `\"/\"`, like `\"/home/xabier/Documents/UAB/My_texts/File.txt\"`. However, in Windows directory trees always start in the drive in which data is saved, typically `\"C:\\` and the separation between subdirectories is specified with an inverse bar `\"\\\"`. For example `\"C:\\Users\\xabier\\Documents\\UAB\\My_texts\\File.txt\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comment on File names\n",
    "If you really are into jumping from the naive user side to a more advanced computer user side, you should end today naming files with spaces and strange characters. This is because many interpreters (not the case of Python, but you will save problems in the future) interpret the space as a finish mark and will stop reading the name of the file at that poingt. That is, avoid naming files as `\"¡My first text file is sugoi!.txt\"` and instead name it `\"My_first_text_file_is_sugoi.txt\"` or something of the like."
