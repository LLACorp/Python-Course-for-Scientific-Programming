    "A dictionary is an ordered collection of different kinds of values (lists, floats, strings, other dictionaries etc.) each with its own name, but all gathered in a same variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry in a dictionary is made of a pair `key: value`. The `key` is the \"name\" of the variable you save in `value`. It is a way to have many variables of different sorts, but all under a same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces `{}`. A colon `:` separates each key from its associated value:  \n",

    "\n",
    "Then, in order to access one of the values in `d`, instead of indexing by their position, as we used to with the lists, we index them by their keys. Say, `d[<key1>]` would give us `<value1>`.\n",

    "The keys can be any sort of what is called **immutable** objects (we will know about them later on), but in general we use rather **strings** or **int**s."

    "\n",
    "Even if it might be cool to employ a recursive algorithm, it is typically avoided and the recursive version is used instead. Among others, this is because each time we generate a new \"parallel world\" in each function call, there are a number of variables and stuff that need to be initialized and saved for each world. This causes a bigger memory overhead than the iterable generated to support the iterative version, for a naive recursive algorithm. Also, this might make it slower if not correctly implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you do it recursive in a well-thought manner, you can actually make the code faster (reduce the **complexity** of an algorithm)! If the first time a computation is made in a tree of computations that each depends on the previous, you save in memory the result, you can avoid redundant calculations that otherwise would be performed."
