    "As a side note, remember that everything in the end (in the memeory of the computer) is saved and manipulated in bits (0-s and 1-s), this means that in reality in the memory of the computer there is nowhere a letter `a`. Instead if for example we want to encode the 27 characters of the alphabet, we could give each letter a unique tag using sequences of 5 bits (there are 32 possible sequences since $2^5=32$). If so, we could say `a` will be the sequence $00000$, `b` will be $00001$, `c` will be $00010$ etc. Such that in memory we will save the text `acb` as $000000001000001$. Then when we want to read it again, we will need to specify in which encoding the text is codified to be able to convert it back to characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first encoding standards for text was the so called ASCII standard based on the alphabet and symbols for English, which used 7 bits to encode about 127 different symbols or characters, among them the alphabetic characters, the numerical digits, symbols like `?` or `!` and some other special characters like `\\n` representing line breaks, or the EOF representing the end of a text file, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today there are several standardized encodings, and each operative system (OS) has its preferred ones. ASCII was the main encoding used in Internet until December 2007, when it was surpassed by UTF-8 using 8 bits (and thus allowing double symbols to be coded).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function `open()`, we can also add a thrid argument indicating the **encoding** for the characters we will deal with in this file. If we do not specify it, Python will just use the default encoding on the OS. But in general, we could specify any of the encodings listed in the following table of the official Python documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings)\n",
    "\n",

A **relative path** is a path given from the point the Python interpreter is being executed and on (in our case, from the directory of the Jupyter Notebook and down there). For instance, imagine you have the following tree of directories under the folder where this Jupyter Notebook called `Lecture_05.ipynb` is:"

    "##### Important note for Windows vs Linux/MacOS users\n",
    "In Linux and MacOS, the directory structure always starts in a `\"/\"` and the next subfolders are indicated with a bar `\"/\"`, like `\"/home/navau/Documents/UAB/My_texts/File.txt\"`. However, in Windows directory trees always start in the drive in which data is saved, typically `\"C:\\` and the separation between subdirectories is specified with an inverse bar `\"\\\"`. For example `\"C:\\Users\\navau\\Documents\\UAB\\My_texts\\File.txt\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comment on File names\n",
    "If you really are into jumping from the naive user-side to a more advanced-computer user-side, you should **end** today **naming files** with **spaces** and strange characters! This is because many interpreters (not the case of Python, but you will save problems in the future) interpret the space as a finish mark and will stop reading the name of the file at that point. That is, avoid naming files as `\"¡My first text file is sugoi!.txt\"` and instead name it `\"My_first_text_file_is_sugoi.txt\"` or something of the like.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comment on Buffers\n",
    "In reality, when you tell the file handle `.write(\"this or that\")`, the text is not immediately saved in the text file in the memory of the computer. This is because these tasks are managed by the operative system, and if we keep interrupting its activity constantly by telling it to write little messages to memory the task could get very inefficient. Instead, the text is first accumulated in a temporary so called **buffer** by Python (in the RAM), until this text buffer is full and then the whole chunk of information to be saved is given as a whole to the operating system, who will now take care to write the text as soon as possible to disk. Note that in fact, the operating system will take that text and actually save it in yet another buffer, until it finds the moment to save stuff to disk. When you call `.close()` not only the file stops to be opened by python and lets other programs open it safely, but all the buffers are flushed and you can be sure the text is now really saved in disk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it could happen that if the computer suddenly shuts down while `close` has still not been called, the data written with `write` is lost forever (because it was still on an intermediate buffer). To avoid it and explicitly force python to send the buffer as it is to the operative system, you can use `filehandle.flush()`. In addition, you could actually force the operative system to write to disk using `os.fsync()`, a function from the `os` library, which you can import with `import os`. Yet, normally you need not force the operative system to do so, it is fast enough for general use-cases."
